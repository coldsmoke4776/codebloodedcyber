# Becoming a Rustacean - Part 1 (Installing the Damn Thing/Setup)

![Main Image Alt Text](/images/blog/becoming-a-rustacean-images/crustacean.jpg)

## Introduction

Start with a hook that grabs the reader's attention. Briefly introduce the topic and why it's important or interesting. You can use **bold** or *italic* text for emphasis.

## Main Content Section 1

Break your content into logical sections. Use subheadings (##) to structure your article and make it easy to scan.

- Use bullet points for lists
- They're easy to read and break up text

### Subsection (if needed)

For longer articles, you might want to use subsections (###) to further organize your content.

## Main Content Section 2

Continue with your main points. Remember to:

1. Use numbered lists for sequential steps
2. Include relevant examples or case studies
3. Break up long paragraphs for better readability

> Use blockquotes for important statements or quotes. They stand out visually and can be great for emphasizing key points.

## Code Examples (if applicable)

For technical articles, include code snippets:

```python
def example_function():
    print("This is a code example")
    return "It's syntax-highlighted!"
```

## Key Takeaways

Summarize the main points of your article in a bulleted list:

- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Key point 3

## Conclusion

Summarize your main points and provide a call to action or final thoughts.
